# Watermark-Remover

These functions create a Radial Basis Function which is then used to remove pixels which are very irregular to the surrounding pixels in the image given.

This is made to work with tif files.

Run "Run_RBF_Watermark_Remover.m" to see the Watermark remover in action.

You will be prompted to select a pixel with the crosshairs. Please select a pixel which corresponds to the watermark in the image. This will select the pixel as the color which needs to be removed from the image and replaced with colours of the surrounding pixels of the image.
